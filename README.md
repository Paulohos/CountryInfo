# CountryInfo

An app to show some informations about all the coutries in the world.
This app was built using VIPER architecture, because it work very well in a large project in a team environment.

I'm using framaworks like RxSwift and RxCocoa to deal with async problems in an elegant manner. 
R.swift to get strong typed, autocompleted resources like images, fonts and segues. 
ObjectMapper to convert JSON to my entity object. 
Alamofire to meke app's requests.
And finally SVGKit to converto a .SVG image to UIImage.
